<h1>The Best Movies According to Alessandro</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movie (Franchises) of all Time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>The Lord of The Rings</h3>
<p>The books themselves have been a masterpiece on its own. Peter Jackson's trilogy did them justice and managed to catch the fascinating world of Tolkien on film. <br/>
Starting with "The Fellowship of the Ring", followed by "The Two Towers", and ending masterfully with "The Return of the King", those movies were part of my childhood and are still my first choice as of today.</p>

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>Based on the books by J.K. Rowling, these movies have given an entire generation a world to relate to. <br>
Every single kid wanted to receive a letter for their 11th birthday but none of us did (or did some and us Muggles are just unaware?) <br/>
I stopped counting how many times I've watched the eight movies. However, I'm certain it wasn't enough.</p>

<h3>Pulp Fiction (I guess?)</h3>
<p>With my 3rd choice I struggled the most, as there were many movies in contention. <br/>
The Godfather, Goodfellas, the Batman Trilogy, Interstellar,...the list seems endless. <br>
Yet, I have chosen Pulp Fiction. A movie that really impressed me when I watched it the first time. <br>
Even though I haven't watched it in ages, I still believe it holds up and remains Tarantino's finest work.</p>
