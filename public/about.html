<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>For several years, I was wondering if web developing might be my calling. The more I read and hear about it, the more
  I started to believe that this might be my calling. And finally in 2024, after studying economics and working for more
  than 10 years in various Marketing & Sales roles within the Food and Radiology industries, I've decided to give it a try.</p>

<p>I have searched the web for the ideal way of learning web development. I knew that I need some sort of guidance since I was
  starting from scratch. Finally, I found the right one: The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp from Dr. Angela Yu. Now I'm spending the majority of my free time
  learning about HTML, CSS, Javascript, and you name it. And I was right! Web developing appears to be really something that
  I really enjoy doing. A calling you might say.

<p>Still, what you see here is the beginning of my journey. If you see this in its early stage, I do hope you will visit this site 
  in the future again (and hopefully be suprised by how far it got in the meantime). Together with my portfolio website I will continue
  to develop (pun intended) myself and hoping to be once a "real" web developer.
